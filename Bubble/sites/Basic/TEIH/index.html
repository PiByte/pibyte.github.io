    <h1>the end is near!</h1>
    <p>the online market is going to crash.<br/>
    we have online companies popping up literally everywhere!<br/>
    just like in the 80s when the market crashed due to a massive amount of games getting released!<br/>
    <b>DO NOT</b> invest in these companies if you value your money!<br/>
    <br/>
    don't say i didn't warn you!<br/>
